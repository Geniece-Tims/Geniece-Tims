## 🥅 My Goals:
1. **Master the Basics**: Before diving into specialized topics or advanced technologies, I aim to have a more solid understanding of foundational programming concepts and the primary languages I've worked with.<br>
2. **Build a Portfolio**: Design and develop a collection of personal projects that demonstrate my skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.<br>
3. **Improve Problem Solving**: Regularly practice coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars to sharpen my problem-solving skills.<br>
4. **Focus on Soft Skills**: Technical proficiency is essential, but so are soft skills. Work on effective communication, teamwork, time management, and adaptability.<br>
5. **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on industry news, trends, and emerging technologies. This helps in staying relevant and identifying potential areas of interest or growth.

## 👩🏾‍🏫 Lessons Learned:
Throughout my journey into software development, I've encountered various challenges, each teaching me invaluable lessons. Here are a few that stand out:
<br>
1. **Iterative Development**: Starting small and iterating is the key. It's easier to manage, test, and refine. It's not about how fast you start but how well you finish.<br>
2. **Code Comments Matter**: I used to overlook commenting my code. Now, I realize that they are like breadcrumbs for anyone (including future me) who's trying to understand and potentially improve or debug the code.<br>
3. **The Power of Collaboration**: No one has all the answers. Teaming up with others has helped me look at problems from different perspectives and come up with more rounded solutions.<br>
4. **Embracing Failure**: Each failure is a stepping stone to success. Instead of getting discouraged, I've learned to analyze my mistakes, learn from them, and move forward with a better approach.<br>
5. **Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves rapidly. The importance of staying updated and continuously learning cannot be emphasized enough. This not just enhances skills but also instills a sense of confidence.<br>

*I believe these lessons, among many others, shape not just how I code but also how I approach challenges and work in teams. If you have any similar experiences or lessons to share, I'd love to hear them!*

## 📆 Upcoming Projects:
* Graduation Capstone: Aug. 17th - Sep. 8th
